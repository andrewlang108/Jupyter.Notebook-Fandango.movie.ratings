# Jupyter.Notebook-Fandango.movie.ratings
This is a guided project, completed following prompts given through a course by DataQuest.

The goal of this project is to verify if Fandango has fixed their rating inflation practices.
Two files were imported that contained movie rating data. This includes the year of release, name, fandango stars, and fandango adjusted rating value. 
Popular movies from 2015 were compared with popular movies from 2016 in order to determine if Fandango has fixed their rating inflation practices. 

A density plot was created in the notebook to commpare ratings from 2015 and 2016. Their shapes are quite different, with 2015 being clearly left-skewed. and 2016 having a near-normal distribution. 

# Conclusion
Based on the density plot and additionally compared summary statistics (mean, median, mode), we can determine that Fandango has decreased their ratings inflation. However, it is unclear if there is still some amount of fabrication occuring.
